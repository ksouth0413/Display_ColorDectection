# Display_ColorDectection

>>Explanation

This is for detecting amount of RGB in various display(LCD, LED, OLED).
Acutally, you can add EPD but have to use Rasberrypi insteadof using Arduino Uno.

>>Limit

The environment of this experiment is not same, becuase by using arduino and cheap display panel,
we cannot make same conditions like same amount of light, RGB compositions, size of panel, etc.

>>Earnings of this experiment

Althought this experiment has many limits, we can know color sensor functions well
(it means detect RGB componetn well) and blue color filter functions as well.
